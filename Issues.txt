Note to self:

- Fix id's (either make every json have own id type, like member_id, or make id's uniform all around)
- Add class name (fix class structure both in users.py and main.py)

What to do:
- Create group page, where you select a specific group and go to its page. All are the same
  except that they have their own individual information. 
  --> Page contains payment link (with auto select on group payment) ****
  --> Forum (to be added soon)  
- CSS in all pages (make it look prettier)
- Work on treasurer (Likely not enough time to finish)
